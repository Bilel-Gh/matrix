# Matrix

A Python implementation of foundational linear algebra concepts focusing on vector and matrix operations.

## Description

This project implements various linear algebra operations from scratch including:

### Vector Operations
- Addition and subtraction
- Scalar multiplication 
- Linear combination and interpolation
- Dot product and cross product
- Vector norms (1-norm, 2-norm, infinity norm)
- Angle cosine calculations

### Matrix Operations
- Basic matrix arithmetic
- Matrix multiplication
- Transpose and trace
- Row echelon form
- Determinant and inverse
- Matrix rank
- 3D projection matrices

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
